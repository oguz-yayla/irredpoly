Abstract:

We present the formula for the number of monic irreducible polynomials of degree $n$ over the finite field $\F_q$ where the coefficients of $x^{n-1}$ and $x$ vanish for $n\ge3$. In particular, we give a relation between rational points of algebraic curves over finite fields and the number of elements $a\in\F_{q^n}$ for which Trace$(a)=0$ and Trace$(a^{-1})=0$.
